Management Infrastructure API sample
====================================

Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 introduce a new set of management APIs, called the Windows Management Infrastructure APIs. This includes provider C APIs, client C APIs, and client .Net APIs. These new APIs are more tightly aligned with the CIM standard that is the basis for WMI and provide support for the standard WS-Man protocol via WinRM. This sample demonstrates how to use the Windows Management Infrastructure API to expose data through the new provider model and consume that data through the new client APIs.

**Important**  This sample requires Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 or a later version (any SKU). It doesn't compile in Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows.
