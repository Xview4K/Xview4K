    VssSampleProvider Setup and Uninstall Instructions
========================================================================

(1) Install the virtual storage driver as follows:

    a.  Navigate to the Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.0\bin\x86 directory 
in the Windows SDK. This directory contains virtualstoragevss.sys and 
vstorcontrol.exe.

    b.  Type "vstorcontrol.exe install" at the command prompt.

(2) Install the VSS sample provider as follows:

    a.  Copy the following files from the Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.0\bin
\x86 directory into the VssSampleProvider directory in the downloaded sample.

        •   VssSampleProvider.dll
        •   VstorInterface.dll
        •   install-sampleprovider.cmd
        •   uninstall-sampleprovider.cmd
        •   register_app.vbs
    b.  In the VssSampleProvider directory, type "install-sampleprovider.cmd" at 
the command prompt.


(3) Create one or more virtual LUNs as follows:

    a.  At the command prompt, type "vstorcontrol.exe create fixeddisk -
newimage C:\disk1.image -size 20M -storid "VSS Sample HW Provider"". This 
creates a virtual LUN whose storage identifier is "VSS Sample HW Provider". 
To create additional virtual LUNs, repeat this step.


    Note:
          The VSS sample provider will recognize a LUN only if "VSS Sample HW 
Provider" is a part of the storage identifier. For more information about the 
storage identifier, see LUN-Resync with DiskShadow and Virtual Storage on 
MSDN [http://blogs.msdn.com/b/himanshu_kale/archive/2009/06/02/lun-resync-with
-diskshadow-virtual-storage.aspx]


    b.  Use diskpart.exe or diskmgmt.msc to format the virtual disk and assign a 
drive letter to it.


(4) Run the sample provider by typing the following at the command prompt: "
Run vshadow.exe -p -nw <DriveLetter>"

    where <DriveLetter> is the drive letter of the virtual LUN.

(5) To uninstall the VSS sample provider, do the following:

    a.  In the VssSampleProvider directory, type "uninstall-sampleprovider.cmd" 
at the command prompt.

    b.  Uninstall the virtual storage driver by typing "vstorcontrol.exe uninstall
" at the command prompt.
