DhcpV4FailoverGetScopeStatistics API sample
===========================================

This sample explains the usage of the DhcpV4FailoverGetScopeStatistics API.DHCP is a standardized protocol that enables clients to be dynamically assigned with various configuration parameters, such as an IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and other critical network configuration information. DHCP servers centrally manage such configuration data, and are configured by network administrators with settings that are appropriate for a given network environment. DHCP servers, in turn, communicate with DHCP clients through the use of DHCP messages.

**Note**  The Windows-classic-samples repo contains a variety of code samples that exercise the various programming models, platforms, features, and components available in Windows and/or Windows Server. This repo provides a Visual Studio solution (SLN) file for each sample, along with the source files, assets, resources, and metadata needed to compile and run the sample. For more info about the programming models, platforms, languages, and APIs demonstrated in these samples, check out the documentation on the [Windows Dev Center](https://dev.windows.com). This sample is provided as-is in order to indicate or demonstrate the functionality of the programming models and feature APIs for Windows and/or Windows Server. This sample was created for Windows 8.1 and/or Windows Server 2012 R2 using Visual Studio 2013, but in many cases it will run unaltered using later versions.
