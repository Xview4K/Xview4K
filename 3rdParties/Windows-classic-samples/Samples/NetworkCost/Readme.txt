Network Cost Sample
================================
The SDK Sample NetCostSample, allows the application developer to play with 
the features of the DUSM (Data Usage and Subscription Management). The sample 
allows the user to get Machine cost, destination cost and connection cost. 
Additionally, the user can register for cost change notifications for 
machine cost, destination cost and connection cost and receive the new cost 
when there is a cost change event.
   
Sample Language Implementations
===============================
 	This sample is available in the following language implementations:
C++
 
Files:
=============================================
NetCostEventSink.cpp 
	This file implements the cost event sink for cost change notifications,  and 
includes callback functions to display new cost and profile data values when 
there is a cost change notification.

NetCostSample.cpp
	This file displays the user choice menu, to play with the Sample SDK. This 
file contains the entry point for the sample SDK, and based on user choice, 
the respective functions are executed.  It also displays a list of suggested 
actions for the application developer based on the cost value retrieved.

Utils.cpp
	This file contains the utility functions required for the NetCostSample SDK. 

To build the sample using the command prompt:
=============================================
     1. Open the Command Prompt window and navigate to the directory containing the sample for a specific language.
     2. Type "msbuild netcostsample".


To build the sample using Visual Studio (preferred method):
===========================================================
     1. Open File Explorer and navigate to the directory containing the sample for CPP language.
     2. Double-click the icon for the .sln (solution) file to open the file in Visual Studio.
     3. In the Build menu, select Build Solution. The application will be built in the default \Debug or \Release directory.

To run the sample:
=================
     1. Navigate to the directory that contains the new executable, using the command prompt or File Explorer.
     2. Type netcostsample at the command line, or double-click the icon for netcostsample to launch it from File Explorer.
     
Comments
These are few points to be noted, about this sample SDK.
1.	The DUSM feature API allows the user to register for cost change 
notifications for multiple destination addresses, using 
SetDestinationAddresses; although the NetCostSample SDK restricts the user to 
register for cost change notifications for single destination address at a 
time. This is done to make the sample SDK simple.

2.	When the user registers for cost change notifications, since the events 
are out-of-band this sample, the events have to be generated by doing one of 
the following:

	•	Connect or disconnect Ethernet
	•	Switch between mobile broadband and wifi
	•	Change cost for mobile broadband using WCM Sample SDK which defines the use 
of set cost feature for WCM API.
