HttpCalculatorWithUsernameXmlTokenOverSslClientExample

Description
===========

This example shows a HTTP client that uses service proxy to talk to a
calculator service, with XML security token over SSL mixed-mode
security.  In this setup, the transport connection is protected
(signed, encrypted) by SSL which also provides server authentication.
Client authentication is provided by a WS-Security username/password
pair that is used as an XML security token by the example.

Note that this client side example uses the WS_XML_TOKEN_MESSAGE_SECURITY_BINDING.  An equivalent way of
doing the same client side security using the WS_USERNAME_MESSAGE_SECURITY_BINDINGis illustrated by the
example HttpCalculatorWithUsernameOverSslClientExample.

A matching server side for both of these client side examples is
provided by the example HttpCalculatorWithUserNameOverSslServiceExample.
