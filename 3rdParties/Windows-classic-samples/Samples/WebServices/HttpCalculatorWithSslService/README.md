Windows Web Services HTTP calculator with SSL service sample
============================================================

This sample demonstrates how the [Windows Web Services API](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd430435) can use the service host for hosting a calculator service over HTTP, with SSL transport security.

**Note**  The Windows-classic-samples repo contains a variety of code samples that exercise the various programming models, platforms, features, and components available in Windows and/or Windows Server. This repo provides a Visual Studio solution (SLN) file for each sample, along with the source files, assets, resources, and metadata needed to compile and run the sample. For more info about the programming models, platforms, languages, and APIs demonstrated in these samples, check out the documentation on the [Windows Dev Center](https://dev.windows.com). This sample is provided as-is in order to indicate or demonstrate the functionality of the programming models and feature APIs for Windows and/or Windows Server. This sample was created for Windows 8.1 and/or Windows Server 2012 R2 using Visual Studio 2013, but in many cases it will run unaltered using later versions.
