NCrypt key derivation sample
============================

This sample demonstrates how to create a key by using a key derivation function (KDF) and how to derive ephemeral symmetric keys from the persisted KDF key. The sample uses the NCryptKeyDerivation function.

**Warning**  This sample requires Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 or a later version (any SKU) and doesn't compile in Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows.

**Note**  The Windows-classic-samples repo contains a variety of code samples that exercise the various programming models, platforms, features, and components available in Windows and/or Windows Server. This repo provides a Visual Studio solution (SLN) file for each sample, along with the source files, assets, resources, and metadata needed to compile and run the sample. For more info about the programming models, platforms, languages, and APIs demonstrated in these samples, check out the documentation on the [Windows Dev Center](https://dev.windows.com). This sample is provided as-is in order to indicate or demonstrate the functionality of the programming models and feature APIs for Windows and/or Windows Server. This sample was created for Windows 8.1 and/or Windows Server 2012 R2 using Visual Studio 2013, but in many cases it will run unaltered using later versions.
