Enumerate app packages sample
=============================

This sample shows how to enumerate all app packages installed on the system, and enumerate every user that installed each package.

Users acquire your app as an app package. Windows uses the information in an app package to install the app on a per-user basis, and ensure that all traces of the app are gone from the device after all users who installed the app uninstall it. Each package consists of the files that constitute the app, along with a package manifest file that describes the app to Windows.

The sample uses [**PackageManager.FindPackages()**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/br240969) to find all installed packages for all users.

**Warning**  This sample requires Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 or a later version (any SKU); it doesn't compile with Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows.

**Note**  The Windows-classic-samples repo contains a variety of code samples that exercise the various programming models, platforms, features, and components available in Windows and/or Windows Server. This repo provides a Visual Studio solution (SLN) file for each sample, along with the source files, assets, resources, and metadata needed to compile and run the sample. For more info about the programming models, platforms, languages, and APIs demonstrated in these samples, check out the documentation on the [Windows Dev Center](https://dev.windows.com). This sample is provided as-is in order to indicate or demonstrate the functionality of the programming models and feature APIs for Windows and/or Windows Server. This sample was created for Windows 8.1 and/or Windows Server 2012 R2 using Visual Studio 2013, but in many cases it will run unaltered using later versions.
