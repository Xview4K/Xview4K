# WPF Sharing content source app sample

Shows how a managed Win32 app can participate in the [Share contract](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/app-to-app/share-data).
There is a corresponding [Sharing content UWP source app sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=620596) available. 

Some of the classes you might want to review in more detail are the 
[DataTransferManager](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br205932) class, 
which you use to initiate a share operation, and the [DataPackage](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br205873) class, 
which you use to package the content. Because each share scenario usually involves two apps—the source app 
and a target app that receives the content—we recommend you install and deploy the 
[Sharing content target app sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=231519) when you install and run this one. 
This way, you can see how sharing works from end to end. 

**Note** Win32 is not supported for Sharing content target apps.

This sample covers how to share content in a variety of formats, including:

-   Text
-   Web link
-   Files

**Note** This sample requires Visual Studio 2015 to build and Windows 10 to execute.
 
To obtain information about Windows 10 development, go to the [Windows Dev Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=532421)

To obtain information about Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 and the tools for developing Windows apps, go to [Visual Studio 2015](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=532422)
