This folder contains media that is used by other samples in the Windows Media Player SDK.

The following files are audio files:
	house.wma (contains script commands)
	laure.wma
	jeanne.wma (contains markers)
	mellow.wma
        multilang.wma (contains multiple audio language tracks)
        laure_multi.wma (contains multiple value attribute metadata)

	
The following files are video files:
	glass.wmv (contains URLs)
	seattle.wmv
	smooth.wmv 

The following file contains arbitrary data:
        rendering.asf (same music content as laure.wma)
	
Note that glass.wmv and smooth.wmv look like visualizations but are videos that were created through a software video synthesizer.

In order for many of the Windows Media Player SDK samples to work, the sample digital media files must be added to your library. To do this, run the file named loader.hta and follow the directions. Loader.hta can be found in the same folder as this text file.
