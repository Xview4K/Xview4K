This sample shows how to do "URL flips" in a Web page. URLs are embedded into a media file and when encountered, will display the Web page in Microsoft Internet Explorer using the URL.

This sample might require certain digital media files to be added to your library. To do this, run the file named loader.hta, which is located in the Windows Media Player SDK sample media folder, and follow the directions.

The Web page is a frame that has two panes (leftpage.htm and ritepage.htm). The left pane contains the embedded Windows Media Player ActiveX control. The left pane will be where the Web page will be displayed as defined by any URLs embedded in the media file. You can embed URLs in a media file using Microsoft ASFIndexer or other tools. The control uses the defaultFrame property through a PARAM tag to define where the Web page will be displayed (the name is defined by the name element of the FRAME element).

Note that the video playing is not a visualization. The video was generated by a software video synthesizer.

See the Windows Media Player SDK for more information.
