This sample shows a simple use of markers.

This sample might require certain digital media files to be added to your library. To do this, run the file named loader.hta, which is located in the Windows Media Player SDK sample media folder, and follow the directions.

Markers are embedded in Windows Media audio and video files to indicate an absolute named position in the file. You can add markers with ASFIndexer or other tools.

Press Play to start an audio file with markers in it. Once the file is playing, press one of the three buttons to move the media to a specific marker in the file. Once the file pointer is moved to that marker, the number of markers is displayed, as well as the current marker name and marker time.

See the Windows Media Player SDK for more information about markers.
