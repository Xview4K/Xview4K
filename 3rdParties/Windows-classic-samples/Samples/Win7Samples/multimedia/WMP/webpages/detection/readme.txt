        Detection Sample Application

This sample might require certain digital media files to be added to your library. To do this, run the file named loader.hta, which is located in the Windows Media Player SDK sample media folder, and follow the directions.

This application demonstrates how to detect which
version of Windows Media Player is available on the
end user's computer and which browser is in use.
