RemoteSkin sample

This sample demonstrates using a remoted Windows Media Player ActiveX control with a skin as the user interface. When you click Go to Media Library, the remoted control transitions to the Player and sets the current task pane as Library. Double-clicking a media item in the library initiates a transition back to the remoting application and plays the selected file. 

Note that this sample uses ATL. This means you must install Microsoft Visual Studio to compile this sample.
