This sample shows the minimum coding to produce a skin that plays and stops.

This sample might require certain digital media files to be added to your library. To do this, run the file named loader.hta, which is located in the Windows Media Player SDK sample media folder, and follow the directions.

The predefined buttons PLAYELEMENT and STOPELEMENT create buttons that work with BUTTONGROUP. 

Note that you must have a playlist with a selected item (from a previous Windows Media Player session). If you do not, right-click on the skin to open a media file.

Also note that if the digital media file that plays contains video, the skin may transition to full mode.

See the Windows Media Player SDK for more information.
