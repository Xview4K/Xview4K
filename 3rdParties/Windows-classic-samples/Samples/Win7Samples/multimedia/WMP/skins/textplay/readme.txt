This sample shows how to create a drawer effect by hiding and showing parts of the skin. See the drawer sample for another way to do this by using a different view.

This sample might require certain digital media files to be added to your library. To do this, run the file named loader.hta, which is located in the Windows Media Player SDK sample media folder, and follow the directions.

The user interface for this skin is similar to the text sample. Clicking on Playlist extends the height of the skin, exposing the playlist. Clicking on the Playlist button again hides the playlist.

See the Windows Media Player SDK for more information.
