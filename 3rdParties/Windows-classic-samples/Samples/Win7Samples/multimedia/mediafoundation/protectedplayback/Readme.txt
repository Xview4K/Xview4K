ProtectedPlayback Sample

    This sample demonstrates how to play DRM-protected media files in
    Media Foundation. 

    Much of the code in this sample is identical to the BasicPlayback
    sample. You may want to look at the BasicPlayback sample first,
    and then examine the differences between that sample and the 
    ProtectedPlayback sample. 

    The ProtectedPlayback sample has the following differences:

    - winmain.cpp: 

      Includes code to handle content enabler events. See the
      OnContentEnablerMessage function.


    - player.cpp:

      The code to create the media session is different. See the
      CPlayer::CreateSession method. 


    - ContentEnabler.h, ContentEnabler.cpp:

      Implements the IMFContentProtectionManager interface.
 

    - WebHHelper.h, WebHelper.cpp:

      Manages the browser control, for non-silent enabler actions.


This sample requires Windows Vista or later.
