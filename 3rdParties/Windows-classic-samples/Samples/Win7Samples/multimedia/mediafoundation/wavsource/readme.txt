WavSource Sample

    This sample implements a media source that parses audio .wav 
    files. The sample demonstrates how to write a custom media source
    for Media Foundation. It also shows how to register a byte-stream
    handler for the source, so that the Media Foundation source 
    resolver can discover the media source.

    To keep the sample code as simple as possible, the media source 
    only parses .wav files that contain uncompressed PCM audio, mono 
    or stereo. 

    This sample does not support protected playback.

    This sample requires Windows Vista or later.


Windows 7:

    In Windows 7, Media Foundation already provides an in-box byte-
    stream handler for .wav files, and the registry entry for it is 
    protected using Windows Resource Protection (WRP). Therefore, the
    sample DLL will fail to register for .wav files.

    Instead, the sample registers the byte-stream handler for the 
    file extension ".xyz". To run the sample, rename a .wav to use 
    this file extension.


Usage

    The sample builds a DLL. To use the sample, do the following.

    Windows Vista:

      1. Register the DLL with Regsvr32.exe.

      2. Open a .wav file from a Media Foundation playback 
         application.


    Windows 7:

      1. Register the DLL with Regsvr32.exe.

      2. Take an existing .wav file and rename the file extension 
         to '.xyz'.

      2. Open the .xyz file from a Media Foundation playback 
         application.
   

   Note: You must run as administrator to register the DLL.
