DXVA-HD Sample
================================
This sample demonstrates DirectX Video Acceleration High Definition 
(DXVA-HD). DXVA-HD is a low-level video processing API.

This sample is essentially a port of the DXVA2_VideoProc sample to
use the DXVA-HD interfaces. It has the same basic functionality, and
most of the keyboard commands are the same. 

DXVA-HD has additional capabilities that make it more powerful for
video processing than the original DXVA-VP APIs introduced in Windows
Vista:

 -	Any stream can be either RGB or YUV.
 -	Any stream can be either progressive or interlaced.
 -	The background color can be RGB.
 -	Luma keying.
 -	The device can switch between blend, bob, and adaptive 
        deinterlacing.
 -	Mandatory output formats: X8R8G8B8 and A8R8G8B8
 -	Mandatory input formats: X8R8G8B8, A8R8G8B8, YUY2 and AYUV
