Platform SDK Sample: Game Explorer and Game Definition File Sample

Requirements:
Requires Visual Studio 2005 (uses Active Template Library)

The Game Definition File Sample demonstrates how to:

   - Add, Remove, and Update games in the Game Explorer using the IGameExplorer COM Object
   - List the installed games on the local system via WMI
   - Create a Game Definition File (including the Game Definition File XML Schema)
    
For more information on the Game Definition File Schemas  or the Parental Controls

The latest DirectX SDK contains a utility to create Game Definition Files and Resource Compiler scripts.
