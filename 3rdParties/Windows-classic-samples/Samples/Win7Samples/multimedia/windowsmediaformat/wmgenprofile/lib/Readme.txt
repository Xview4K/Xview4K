       Static Library : GenProfile
========================================================================

Synopsis:
    The GenProfile library sample demonstrates the creation of Windows Media Format profiles.
    

Building the sample:
    To build the sample, open the GenProfile workspace and build the GenProfile project.
    NOTE: The file wmsdkidl.h requires the latest version of rpcndr.h.  If you receive an error saying, "incorrect <rpcndr.h> version", you are not using the most recent version of the rpcndr.h file.  You can get a newer version by installing the latest Platform SDK.  Alternatively, you can use MIDL on wmsdkidl.idl to generate a compatible wmsdkidl.h.

    - Creation of media types and streams for various stream types (audio, video, script, image, file transfer, and web)
