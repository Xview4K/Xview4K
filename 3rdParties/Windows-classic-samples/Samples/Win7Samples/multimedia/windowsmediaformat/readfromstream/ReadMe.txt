       CONSOLE APPLICATION : ReadFromStream
========================================================================


This sample shows how to read data from an IStream with the Reader. The IStream source has been
implemented to use a file in Windows Media Format (WMA/WMV/ASF).

Usage :
	ReadFromStream -i <InFile>
	
where <InFile> specifies the name of the input file.

Note: This sample does not show how to process the media samples coming out of the Reader. For examples of how to process media samples, please refer to other samples, e.g. AudioPlayer, that are included with the SDK.
