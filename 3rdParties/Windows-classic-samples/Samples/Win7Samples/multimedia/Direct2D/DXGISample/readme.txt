Prerequisites
===============================
Microsoft Windows® 7
Windows® Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows 7 and .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 
March 2009 DirectX SDK

Additional Installation Instructions
===============================
This sample requires the DirectX SDK. 


Configuring without Visual Studio
==================================================
1. Open a Windows SDK command shell. 

2. Type 
	"<drive>:\Program Files\Microsoft DirectX SDK <version>\Utilities\bin\dx_setenv.cmd"

   (For 64-bit versions of Windows, type "<drive>:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft DirectX SDK <version>\Utilities\bin\dx_setenv.cmd")

   where <drive> is the drive to which the DirectX SDK was installed and version is the version you downloaded. For example,
   "C:\Program Files\Microsoft DirectX SDK (March 2009)\Utilities\bin\dx_setenv.cmd"

   You must perform this step each type you compile the sample.

3. To compile the sample, type vcbuild /u DXGISample.sln.


Configuring for Visual Studio (preferred method)
==================================================
After installing the DirectX SDK, you must configure Visual Studio
to use the executables and include files provided by the DirectX SDK. You must configure Visual Studio for
each platform (Win32 or x64) you want to build against. 


For building against the Win32 platform:
1.	Launch Visual Studio 2008.

2.	Open the Tools menu and select Options…. The Options dialog box appears.

3.	In the left pane of the Options dialog box, expand the Projects and Solutions node.

4.	Under Project and Solutions, select VC++ Directories.

5.	In the right pane, set the "Platform" drop-down list box to Win32 and the 
	"Show directories for" drop-down list box to Executable files. 

6.	At the bottom of the list of executable file directories, create a new entry for the DirectX SDK:  

		* For machines running 32-bit versions of Windows, add the following path:
			<drive>:\Program Files\Microsoft DirectX SDK <version>\Utilities\bin\x86
		   (If there was already such an entry, move it to the bottom of the list.)
		
		* For machines running 64-bit versions of Windows, add the following path:
			<drive>:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft DirectX SDK <version>\Utilities\bin\x86
		   (If there was already such an entry, move it to the bottom of the list.)
 
7.	Set the "Show directories for" drop-down list box to "Include" files.

8.	At the bottom of the list of directories, create a new entry for the DirectX SDK: 

		* For machines running 32-bit versions of Windows, add the following path:
			<drive>:\Program Files\Microsoft DirectX SDK <version>\Include
		   (If there was already such an entry, move it to the bottom of the list.)

		* For machines running 64-bit versions of Windows, add the following path:
			<drive>:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft DirectX SDK <version>\Include
		   (If there was already such an entry, move it to the bottom of the list.)

9. 	Set the "Show directories for" drop-down list box to "Library" files.

10.     At the bottom of the list of directories, create a new entry for the DirectX SDK:


		* For machines running 32-bit versions of Windows, add the following path:
			<drive>:\Program Files\Microsoft DirectX SDK <version>\Lib\x86
		   (If there was already such an entry, move it to the bottom of the list.)

		* For machines running 64-bit versions of Windows, add the following path:
			<drive>:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft DirectX SDK <version>\Lib\x86
		   (If there was already such an entry, move it to the bottom of the list.)



11.	Click OK.

For building against the x64 platform:
1.	Launch Visual Studio 2008.

2.	Open the Tools menu and select Options…. The Options dialog box appears.

3.	In the left pane of the Options dialog box, expand the Projects and Solutions node.

4.	Under Project and Solutions, select VC++ Directories.

5.	In the right pane, set the "Platform" drop-down list box to x64 and the 
	"Show directories for" drop-down list box to Executable files. 

6.	At the bottom of the list of executable file directories, create a new entry for the DirectX SDK:  

		* For machines running 32-bit versions of Windows, add the following path:
			<drive>:\Program Files\Microsoft DirectX SDK <version>\Utilities\bin\x86
		   (If there was already such an entry, move it to the bottom of the list.)

		* For machines running 64-bit versions of Windows, add the following path:
			<drive>:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft DirectX SDK <version>\Utilities\bin\x64
		   (If there was already such an entry, move it to the bottom of the list.)
 
7.	Set the "Show directories for" drop-down list box to "Include" files.
8.	At the bottom of the list of directories, create a new entry for the DirectX SDK: 

		* For machines running 32-bit versions of Windows, add the following path:
			<drive>:\Program Files\Microsoft DirectX SDK <version>\Include
		   (If there was already such an entry, move it to the bottom of the list.)

		* For machines running 64-bit versions of Windows, add the following path:
			<drive>:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft DirectX SDK <version>\Include
		   (If there was already such an entry, move it to the bottom of the list.)

9. 	Set the "Show directories for" drop-down list box to "Library" files.

10.     At the bottom of the list of directories, create a new entry for the DirectX SDK:


		* For machines running 32-bit versions of Windows, add the following path:
			<drive>:\Program Files\Microsoft DirectX SDK <version>\Lib\x64
		   (If there was already such an entry, move it to the bottom of the list.)

		* For machines running 64-bit versions of Windows, add the following path:
			<drive>:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft DirectX SDK <version>\Lib\x64
		   (If there was already such an entry, move it to the bottom of the list.)



11.	Click OK.





Building the Sample
===============================


To build the sample using the command prompt:
=============================================
     1. Open the Command Prompt window and run the dx_setenv.cmd (see the Additional Installation Instructions section for more information.)
     2. Navigate to the sample directory.
     2. Type vcbuild /u DxgiSample.sln.


To build the sample using Visual Studio 2008 (preferred method):
================================================
     1. Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the sample directory.
     2. Double-click the icon for the .sln (solution) file to open the file in Visual Studio.
     3. In the Build menu, select Build Solution. The application will be built in the default \Debug or \Release directory.
