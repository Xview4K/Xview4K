Microsoft Corporation Technical Documentation License Agreement (Standard)

READ THIS! THIS IS A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN MICROSOFT CORPORATION 
("MICROSOFT") AND THE RECIPIENT OF THESE MATERIALS, WHETHER AN INDIVIDUAL OR AN 
ENTITY ("YOU"). IF YOU HAVE ACCESSED THIS AGREEMENT IN THE PROCESS OF 
DOWNLOADING MATERIALS ("MATERIALS") FROM A MICROSOFT WEB SITE, BY CLICKING "I 
ACCEPT", DOWNLOADING, USING OR PROVIDING FEEDBACK ON THE MATERIALS, YOU AGREE 
TO THESE TERMS. IF THIS AGREEMENT IS ATTACHED TO MATERIALS, BY ACCESSING, USING 
OR PROVIDING FEEDBACK ON THE ATTACHED MATERIALS, YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS.

1. For good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which 
are acknowledged, You and Microsoft agree as follows:

(a) If You are an authorized representative of the corporation or other entity 
designated below ("Company"), and such Company has executed a Microsoft 
Corporation Non-Disclosure Agreement that is not limited to a specific subject 
matter or event ("Microsoft NDA"), You represent that You have authority to act 
on behalf of Company and agree that the Confidential Information, as defined in 
the Microsoft NDA, is subject to the terms and conditions of the Microsoft NDA 
and that Company will treat the Confidential Information accordingly; 

(b) If You are an individual, and have executed a Microsoft NDA, You agree that 
the Confidential Information, as defined in the Microsoft NDA, is subject to 
the terms and conditions of the Microsoft NDA and that You will treat the 
Confidential Information accordingly; or

(c)If a Microsoft NDA has not been executed, You (if You are an individual), or 
Company (if You are an authorized representative of Company), as applicable, 
agrees: (a) to refrain from disclosing or distributing the Confidential 
Information to any third party for five (5) years from the date of disclosure 
of the Confidential Information by Microsoft to Company/You; (b) to refrain 
from reproducing or summarizing the Confidential Information; and (c) to take 
reasonable security precautions, at least as great as the precautions it takes 
to protect its own confidential information, but no less than reasonable care, 
to keep confidential the Confidential Information. You/Company, however, may 
disclose Confidential Information in accordance with a judicial or other 
governmental order, provided You/Company either (i) gives Microsoft reasonable 
notice prior to such disclosure and to allow Microsoft a reasonable opportunity 
to seek a protective order or equivalent, or (ii) obtains written assurance 
from the applicable judicial or governmental entity that it will afford the 
Confidential Information the highest level of protection afforded under 
applicable law or regulation. Confidential Information shall not include any 
information, however designated, that: (i) is or subsequently becomes publicly 
available without Your/Company's breach of any obligation owed to Microsoft; 
(ii) became known to You/Company prior to Microsoft's disclosure of such 
information to You/Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; (iii) 
became known to You/Company from a source other than Microsoft other than by 
the breach of an obligation of confidentiality owed to Microsoft; or (iv) is 
independently developed by You/Company. For purposes of this paragraph, 
"Confidential Information" means nonpublic information that Microsoft 
designates as being confidential or which, under the circumstances surrounding 
disclosure ought to be treated as confidential by Recipient. "Confidential 
Information" includes, without limitation, information in tangible or 
intangible form relating to and/or including released or unreleased Microsoft 
software or hardware products, the marketing or promotion of any Microsoft 
product, Microsoft's business policies or practices, and information received 
from others that Microsoft is obligated to treat as confidential.

2. You may review these Materials only (a) as a reference to assist You in 
planning and designing Your product, service or technology ("Product") to 
interface with a Microsoft Product as described in these Materials; and (b) to 
provide feedback on these Materials to Microsoft. All other rights are retained 
by Microsoft; this agreement does not give You rights under any Microsoft 
patents. You may not (i) duplicate any part of these Materials, (ii) remove 
this agreement or any notices from these Materials, or (iii) give any part of 
these Materials, or assign or otherwise provide Your rights under this 
agreement, to anyone else. 

3. These Materials may contain preliminary information or inaccuracies, and may 
not correctly represent any associated Microsoft Product as commercially 
released. All Materials are provided entirely "AS IS." To the extent permitted 
by law, MICROSOFT MAKES NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, DISCLAIMS ALL EXPRESS, IMPLIED 
AND STATUTORY WARRANTIES, AND ASSUMES NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES OF 
ANY TYPE IN CONNECTION WITH THESE MATERIALS OR ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN 
THEM.

4. If You are an entity and (a) merge into another entity or (b) a controlling 
ownership interest in You changes, Your right to use these Materials 
automatically terminates and You must destroy them. 

5. You have no obligation to give Microsoft any suggestions, comments or other 
feedback ("Feedback") relating to these Materials. However, any Feedback you 
voluntarily provide may be used in Microsoft Products and related 
specifications or other documentation (collectively, "Microsoft Offerings") 
which in turn may be relied upon by other third parties to develop their own 
Products. Accordingly, if You do give Microsoft Feedback on any version of 
these Materials or the Microsoft Offerings to which they apply, You agree: (a) 
Microsoft may freely use, reproduce, license, distribute, and otherwise 
commercialize Your Feedback in any Microsoft Offering; (b) You also grant third 
parties, without charge, only those patent rights necessary to enable other 
Products to use or interface with any specific parts of a Microsoft Product 
that incorporate Your Feedback; and (c) You will not give Microsoft any 
Feedback (i) that You have reason to believe is subject to any patent, 
copyright or other intellectual property claim or right of any third party; or 
(ii) subject to license terms which seek to require any Microsoft Offering 
incorporating or derived from such Feedback, or other Microsoft intellectual 
property, to be licensed to or otherwise shared with any third party. 

6. Microsoft has no obligation to maintain confidentiality of any Microsoft 
Offering, but otherwise the confidentiality of Your Feedback, including Your 
identity as the source of such Feedback, is governed by Your NDA. 

7. This agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Washington. Any 
dispute involving it must be brought in the federal or state superior courts 
located in King County, Washington, and You waive any defenses allowing the 
dispute to be litigated elsewhere. If there is litigation, the losing party 
must pay the other party's reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and other 
expenses. If any part of this agreement is unenforceable, it will be considered 
modified to the extent necessary to make it enforceable, and the remainder 
shall continue in effect. This agreement is the entire agreement between You 
and Microsoft concerning these Materials; it may be changed only by a written 
document signed by both You and Microsoft.
