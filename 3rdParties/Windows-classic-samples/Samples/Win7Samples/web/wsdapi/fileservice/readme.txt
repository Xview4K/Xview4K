SUMMARY
======= 

The FileService sample demonstrates the basic use of the Web Services for
Devices API.  FileService implements the functionality described by
FileService.wsdl.  The sample includes both a client and service.

PLATFORMS SUPORTED
==================

Windows Vista
Windows Server 2008
Windows 7
Windows Server 2008 R2


RUNNING THE SERVER AND CLIENT APPLICATIONS
==========================================

To build, type "nmake" on the command line in this directory

The client and service applications can run on the same Microsoft Windows Vista 
computer or a different one.

To run the service type:

  FileServiceService.exe <path>  (where <path> is the folder of files
                                  to be served)

To run the client type:

  FileServiceClient.exe <path> <device ID> (where <path> is the folder to
                                            receive files and <device ID> is
                                            the ID printed by
                                            FileServiceService.exe)


LAYOUT OF CLASSES AND FUNCTIONS
===============================

Service classes and functions
-----------------------------

CFileServiceService     Implements the IFileService interface, which matches
                        the FileService port type.  This class acts like a
                        COM object (i.e., has AddRef, Release, and
                        QueryInterface methods) and also exposes the
                        GetFile and GetFileList methods, which can be accessed
                        across the wire.

                        The CFileServiceService has one
                        CFileChangeNotificationThread object, which automatically
                        launches a thread to monitor for file system changes.
                        This thread will call back into the CFileServiceService
                        object to issue events to clients.

                        When GetFile is called on the CFileServiceService object,
                        it creates a CSendAttachmentThread object, which
                        automatically launches a thread to write to an attachment.
                        The thread will copy the contents of a file into the
                        attachment and, when it's finished, will close the
                        attachment and destroy itself.

CFileChangeNotificationThread
                        Starts and makes a blocking request for file change
                        notifications.  When a notification is received, this
                        class packages up the results and sends an event to all
                        subscribed clients.

CSendAttachmentThread   Opens a file and writes all data in the file into the
                        supplied attachment object.  When the file has been
                        completely consumed, the object will close the
                        attachment and then delete itself.  The proper way to
                        use this object is to instantiate one, call Start, and
                        then discard the pointer to the object.  It will be
                        responsible for its own cleanup.

StripCbPath             Removes path information from a filename

CloneString             Copies a string into a new buffer allocated with
                        WSDAllocateLinkedMemory

CreateStringList        Copy a string into a PWCHAR_LIST linked-list object.

wmain                   Main function for processing command-line arguments
                        and building a device host which advertises a
                        FileService service.

Client classes and functions
----------------------------

CFileServiceEventNotify Notification class that receives callbacks when a
                        host sends a FileChange event to this client.  This
                        object is passed in as a parameter when the client
                        subscribes to the FileChange event.

CGetFileAsyncCallback   Notification class that is used when the client calls
                        the GetFile method on the service.  This async callback
                        object is passed in as a parameter to the BeginGetFile
                        proxy method, and when the operation completes, the
                        CGetFileAsyncCallback::AsyncOperationComplete method
                        is called.  This object is then responsible for
                        retrieving the results of the GetFile call and saving
                        them to a local file.

Directory               Wrapper function that invokes the GetFileList method
                        on the service.

GetFile                 Wrapper function that sets up a CGetFileAsyncCallback
                        object and then invokes the GetFile method on the
                        service.

wmain                   Main function for processing command-line arguments,
                        creating a proxy for sending service messages to a
                        FileService service, and finally presenting an
                        interactive prompt for sending these messages.


ALTERNATE CODEGEN CONFIG FILES
==============================

Three config files are included with this sample.
*   CodeGen_All.config      Default, includes both host and client options
*   CodeGen_Client.config   Client-only options
*   CodeGen_Host.config     Host-only options

Only the first of these (CodeGen_All.config) is used when generating code
for the FileService sample.  CodeGen_Client.config and CodeGen_Host.config
are provided to illustrate how to generate code for only the client and
only the host.

If you would like to use these alternate config files, follow these steps:
1)  Run WsdCodeGen.exe /generatecode [alternate config file] /gbc
2)  Rebuild the FileServiceContract project, and then rebuild either the
    FileServiceClient or FileServiceService project.
