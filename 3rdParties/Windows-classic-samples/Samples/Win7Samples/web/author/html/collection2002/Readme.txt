================================================
Last Updated: OCT. 18,  2001              

DESCRIPTION
============
Collection 2002 is an ensemble of five utilities and games that aptly demonstrates the 
power and flexibility of DHTML. The Collection makes extensive use of internal 
style sheets and tables to create Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) for the various 
constituent applications, all of which are based on a single graphical theme. 
The individual applications all consist of simple but concise algorithms using the 
sparsest of code utilizing both Microsoft® Visual Basic® Script (VBS) and Java Script. 
This code employs a methodical use of the DHTML Object Model and an array of mathematics 
to bring each game or utility to fruition. Collection 2002 provides an excellent source 
of DHTML code and techniques in an easy to understand format upon which to build more 
complex DHTML applications.

BROWSER/PLATFORM COMPATIBILITY
===============================
Collection 2002 can be used with Microsoft® Internet Explorer 5.01 and greater on 
Windows® 98 and greater platforms.
