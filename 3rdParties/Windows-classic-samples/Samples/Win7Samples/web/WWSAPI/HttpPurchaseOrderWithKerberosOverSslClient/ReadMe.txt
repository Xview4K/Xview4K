HttpPurchaseOrderWithKerberosOverSslClientExample

Description
===========

This example shows a HTTP client that uses service proxy to talk to a PurchaseOrder service,
with kerberos over SSL mixed-mode security.  In this setup, the
transport connection is protected (signed, encrypted) by SSL which
also provides server authentication.  Client authentication is
provided by a kerberos APREQ ticket in a WS-Security header in the
message.
