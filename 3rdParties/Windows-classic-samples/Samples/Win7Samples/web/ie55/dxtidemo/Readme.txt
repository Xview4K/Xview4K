Filters - Filters & Transitions Interactive Demo
=================================================
Last Updated: Jun.27,2000


SUMMARY
========
With Microsoft® Internet Explorer 4.0 and greater, you can apply various 
multimedia-style visual effects to your Web page. You can implement these effects 
in Web pages using cascading style sheet (CSS) properties. By combining filters and 
transitions with basic scripting, you have a powerful tool for creating visually 
engaging and interactive documents. Internet Explorer 5.5 and above supports the 
richest variety of optimized filters.  


DETAILS
========
Visual filters are extensions to CSS properties that change the display of an 
object's contents. In some cases, filters create simple behaviors that could be 
implemented as script. In other cases, a filter exceeds the capabilities of script 
and modifies the rendered appearance of the content of an object. Using filters 
simplifies the task of incorporating sophisticated effects in Web documents. Static 
visual filters affect the display of content, while transitions affect the way 
content changes in an object are displayed.  

The Filters and Transitions Interactive Demo demonstrates most of the Internet Explorer 
5.5 filters and transitions.
