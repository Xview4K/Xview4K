<h2>IIS Samples - ISAPI AuthFilt</h2>
<a name="IIS_AuthFilt"></a>


<p>AuthFilt demonstrates how to write an authentication filter based on an
  external datasource. Authentication is the process of accepting or
  denying a request from a client, so AuthFilt will be notified each time
  an authentication request comes in. </p>

<p><font color="red"><b>Warning</b></font> &nbsp; If you install this ISAPI filter on your server, 
make sure that you have configured IIS to restrict access to the virtual directory that contains 
the filter and the files you want to transmit. Also, set proper access control on the files in their 
physical folder. For more information, 
click <b>Start</b>, <b>Help and Support</b>, and search for <b>Access Control</b>.</p>

intended to be used in a production environment, have not been tested in a production 
environment, and Microsoft does not provide technical support for them.

  <h4><a name="ovr"></a>Sample Overview</h4>
  <p>This sample uses a file (c:\inetsrv\userdb.txt) to keep track of authorized users, 
  but it might be modified to access a database which holds user info.  The file
  c:\inetsrv\userdb.txt does not exist.  Please look at Db.c to see how to
  construct such a file and change the location of the file if you so desire.
  </p>
  <p>
  For each authentication request, AuthFilt first looks in a cache of
  recently authenticated users, and when that fails, AuthFilt looks in the
  userdb.txt file. This shows an efficient way to authorize connections:
  a cache allows the filter to quickly authenticate users, and because
  each request comes in through the filter, speed is critical.</p>

  <h4><a name="bld"></a>Build and Install the Sample</h4>
  <p>To build  this sample using the Visual C++ IDE, the following
  steps must be performed:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open the solution (VS.NET) or desktop (VS6) file to open the project.</li>
    <li>Click <b>Build</b> to create the DLL.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>To build and run this sample without using the Visual C++ IDE, the
  following steps must be performed:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Type <b>NMAKE All</b> from the command line. For example, if your sample files are located in 
	a folder called <code>C:\MySamples</code>, type the following at the command line:
      <pre>cd /d c:\MySamples NMAKE All</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To install this sample, the following steps must be performed:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Copy the AuthFilt.dll and AuthFilt.htm files to a physical folder on your computer. For example, 
  create a folder called <code>C:\Samples</code> and copy the files to that folder.</li>
  <li>Create a virtual directory that maps to the physical folder containing your files. To create 
  a virtual directory, open the Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager by clicking <b>Start</b>, 
  <b>Run</b>, type <code>inetmgr</code> in the text box and click <b>OK</b>. Right-click on the Web 
  site where you want to create a virtual directory, click <b>New</b>, and click <b>Virtual 
  Directory</b>. In the <b>Alias</b> text box, type the name you want for your virtual directory, for 
  example, <code>AuthFilt</code>. In the <b>Directory</b> text box, type the path to the 
  folder that contains your files.
  <li>Install AuthFilt.dll as a filter on the Web site that contains your new virtual directory. In 
  the IIS Manager, right-click the Web site, click <b>Properties</b>, and click the <b>ISAPI Filters</b> 
  tab. Click <b>Add</b> to open the <b>Filter Properties</b> window. Type <code>AuthFilt</code> in the 
  <b>Filter Name</b> text box, and type the path to your filter in the <b>Executable</b> text box. 
  Click <b>OK</b> to complete the installation of the filter.</li>
   <li>Create a user file, <code>c:\inetsrv\userdb.txt</code>, which contains the username/password 
   pairs and the appropriate account the username/password should be mapped to. The format of the 
   file is:<pre>User1:Password1, NTUser1:NTPassword1</pre> Where each line contains the user name and 
   password that will be used to authenticate the user, a comma, and the NT Username and password.
   </li>
  <li>Configure strong security on your new virtual directory. Right-click the virtual directory name, 
  click <b>Properties</b>, and click the <b>Directory Security</b> tab. Press F1 for tips on 
  securing your virtual directory.</li>
  <li>Use Windows Explorer to set restricted access control on the sample .dll file in its physical folder. 
  For more information, click <b>Start</b>, <b>Help and Support</b>, and search for <b>Access Control</b>.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4><a name="run"></a>Run the Sample</h4>
  <p>In order to run this sample, follow the instructions listed below:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Browse to your sample Web files in Internet Explorer (IE). For example, if your files are in a 
  virtual directory called <code>AuthFilt</code>, type 
  <code>http://localhost/AuthFilt/AuthFilt.htm</code> in the <b>Address</b> bar 
  of IE.
    </li>
  </ol>
