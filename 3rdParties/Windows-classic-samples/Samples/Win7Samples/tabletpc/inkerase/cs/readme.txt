Ink Collection Sample
---------------------

This application builds on the Ink Collection Sample sample by demonstrating ink strokes deletion. The sample provides the user with a menu that has four modes to choose from: ink-enabled, erasing at cusp, erasing at intersections, and erasing strokes.

In ink-enabled mode, the InkCollector object collects ink as shown in Ink Collection Sample.

In an erasing mode, segments of existing ink strokes that the user touches with the cursor are erased. Also, the cusps or intersections may be marked with a red circle.
