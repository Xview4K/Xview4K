Scanned Paper Form
------------------

In this sample, a paper form has been scanned as a Portable Network Graphics (PNG) file and specified as the background image at run time for a InkPicture control. The sample uses a message box to display handwriting recognition results.

The sample includes an Extensible Markup Language (XML) file, Formdata.xml. The XML file contains the name of the PNG file. It also contains FieldInfo elements that define rectangular regions on the form where a user can enter ink.
