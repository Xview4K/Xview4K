Ink Divider Sample
------------------

This sample is based on the Ink Collection Sample sample. It shows how to use the Divider object to analyze ink input.

When the form is updated, the sample draws a bounding rectangle around each analyzed unit: words, lines, paragraphs, and drawings. Besides using different colors, these rectangles are enlarged by different amounts to ensure that none of the rectangles is obscured by others. 

The following table specifies the color and enlargement for each analyzed unit.

Analyzed Unit  	Color  	Pixel Enlargement  
.........................................
Word		Green	1
Line		Magenta	3
Paragraph	Blue	5
Drawing		Red	1
