     C++
Files

Prerequisites
Visual Studios 2005 or later



To build the sample using Visual Studio 2005 (preferred method):
================================================
     1. Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the  directory.
     2. Double-click the icon for the .sln (solution) file to open the file in Visual Studio.
     3. In the Build menu, select Build Solution. The application will be built in the default \Debug or \Release directory.


Running the Sample
Currently the file to get the properties of is "c:\foo\cat.txt" so this file should be created or changed in the code.
Also the code tries to get the property "IsThisClassified" from the above file so this property should be added or changed in the code.
Failure to do the above 2 items will result in failures during reading properties from the above mentioned file

To run the sample:
=================
     1. Navigate to the directory that contains the new executable, using the command prompt or Windows Explorer.
     2. Type [ExecutableFile] at the command line, or double-click the icon for [SampleExecutable] to launch it from Windows Explorer.
