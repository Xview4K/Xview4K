FsrmTextReader Project

Demonstrates
	This demonstrations how the FSRM property bag can be used to extract file properties, and streaming interfaces.
	This module will use the property bag to retrieve the file's full path and use its extention to load the 
	registered IFilter and instantiate the filter object with the IStream object of the file from the property bag.

Languages
     This sample is available in the following language implementation:
     C++
     
Files

	FsrmTextReader.vcproj
		This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
		It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and 
		information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
		Application Wizard.

	FsrmTextReader.idl
		This file contains the IDL definitions of the type library, the interfaces
		and co-classes defined in your project.
		It contains the definition for the interface ITextTokenizer
		This file will be processed by the MIDL compiler to generate:
			C++ interface definitions and GUID declarations (FsrmTextReader.h)
			GUID definitions                                (FsrmTextReader_i.c)
			A type library                                  (FsrmTextReader.tlb)

	FsrmTextReader.h
		This file contains the C++ interface definitions and GUID declarations of the
		items defined in FsrmTextReader.idl. It will be regenerated by MIDL during compilation.

	FsrmTextReader.cpp
		This file contains the object map and the implementation of your DLL's exports.

	FsrmTextReader.rc
		This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the
		program uses.

	FsrmTextReader.def
		This module-definition file provides the linker with information about the exports
		required by your DLL. It contains exports for:
			DllGetClassObject  
			DllCanUnloadNow    
			GetProxyDllInfo    
			DllRegisterServer	
			DllUnregisterServer

	/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	Other standard files:

	StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
		These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
		named FsrmTextReader.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

	Resource.h
		This is the standard header file that defines resource IDs.
		
	TextTokenizer.h/cpp
		This implements the ITextTokenizer interface for loading an IFilter and parsing the IStream from
		the FSRM property bag for text searches.
 
Prerequisites

	Windows Server 2008 R2

Building the Sample

To build the sample using the command prompt:
=============================================
     1. Open the Command Prompt window and navigate to the  directory.
     2. Type msbuild ContentBasedClassificationModule.sln


To build the sample using Visual Studio 2005 (preferred method):
================================================
     1. Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the  directory.
     2. Double-click the icon for the ContentBasedClassificationModule.sln (solution) file to open the file in Visual Studio.
     3. In the Build menu, select Build Solution. The application will be built in the default \Debug or \Release directory.
