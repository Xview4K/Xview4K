<h2>Simple DCOM Sample</h2>
<hr>
<p>DCOM is implemented only on Windows NT 4.0 and later versions. This sample
will not work correctly on Windows 95 or on earlier versions of Windows NT.</p>
<p>The SIMPLE sample demonstrates the minimum requirements to use a COM object,
whether it is on the same machine or on a different machine. This sample
consists of a client and a server portion.</p>
<p>The server application, SSERVER.EXE, implements the CLSID_SimpleObject class
as a LocalServer. Instances of the class supports a limited form of the IStream
interface. Calls to Read and Write succeed, but they do nothing. Calls to other
methods fail with E_NOTIMPL.</p>
<p>The client application, SCLIENT.EXE, uses the CLSID_SimpleObject class
implemented by the server.</p>
<p>To compile ----------</p>
<p>Build the sample using the NMAKE command.</p>
<p>To run ------</p>
<p>The run the sample, use the following steps.</p>
<p>Merge the file sserver.reg from the target directory into the registry. - Run
SSERVER. It should display the message &quot;Waiting...&quot;. - Run SCLIENT.
Use no command-line arguments to instantiate the object on the current machine.
Use the name of a remote machine (UNC or DNS) as an argument to instantiate the
object on the remote machine. SCLIENT displays simple information about the
calls it is making on the object.</p>
