<h2>COM+ Sample Applications</h2>
<hr>

<p>COM+ samples help you understand how to use COM+ features. We provide Visual Basic,
Visual C++, and Visual J++ projects that demonstrate the implementation of
services such as queued components and events. 

<h4>How to Use COM+ Samples</h4>
First build the [MSSDK]\samples\com\common\inc and [MSSDK]\samples\com\common\proxystub directores
in the [MSSDK]\samples\com\common folder. Then compile the samples to see how the application runs.
Then you can drill down into the code by stepping through the server components and client implementations.
You can either use these applications as a learning tool, or modify them to use in your applications. The
COM+ samples directory contains the following sub-directories:

<h4>Obtaining Complete Documentation on COM+ Features</h4>
COM+ Samples provide an overview of the sample demonstrating a COM+ feature. For complete documentation and
reference material on implementing a COM+ feature, see the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?URL=/library/psdk/cossdk/betaintr_6qan.htm"> COM+ documentation</a> located in the Microsoft Platform
SDK documentation.

<h4>Build Notes</h4>
To build COM+ samples, you must first build the [MSSDK]\samples\com\common\inc and [MSSDK]\samples\com\common\proxystub
folders in the [MSSDK]\samples\com\common\ folder. It is important to make sure that your development environment
points to the the Microsoft Platform SDK \include, \lib, and \bin directories.
