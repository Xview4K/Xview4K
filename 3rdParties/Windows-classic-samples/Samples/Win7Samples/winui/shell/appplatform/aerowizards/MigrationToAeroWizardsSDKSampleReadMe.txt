This sample illustrates how to migrate your old Wizard 97 wizards to the new Aero wizards.

Wizard97 folder contains code for an existing Wizard 97 wizard.  AeroWizard folder shows the same code after migrating to the new Aero Wizard.  See "MigrationgToAeroWizards" document for more details.

Run AeroWiz.exe and Wizard97.exe to see the visual difference between the two wizards.
