SENDTO: Demonstrates how to write a "Send To" menu

SENDTO demonstrates how an application can display a menu that
lists all of the user's "Send To" extensions and send a file to the
extension the user selects.

From the File menu, choose "Open" to select a file to send.

After selecting a file, pick an item from the "Send To" submenu
and the file you selected will be sent to the specified "Send To"
extension.
