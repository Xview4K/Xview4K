* Sample: MagnifierSample.cpp
*
* Description: Implements a simple control that magnifies the screen, using the Magnification API.
*
* The magnification window is full-screen by default. To switch it to a resizable window, switch
* to the program by using the taskbar and press ESC. In full-screen mode, it is not otherwise possible
* to focus the magnification window, and all keystrokes and mouse clicks are passed through to the
* underlying focused application. In partial-screen mode, the window can receive the focus. 
* 
* Requirements: To compile, link to Magnification.lib. 
*
* The sample is not designed for multimonitor setups.
