The Help API sample is a simple console application that demonstrates using
the methods of the IHxHelpPane interface. When it is run, the user is prompted
to enter a value corresponding to one of the methods. After that, the user
is prompted to enter a value (URI, search keyword) depending on which method
option was selected.

Copy the folder HelpAPISample_VB to your local computer.

You will need to compile the application prior to running it,
as no executable file is included.
