Windows Search Prioritization and Eventing Sample
====================================================
This demo illustrates how to implement and use the IRowsetEvents interface to monitor changes to items belonging to a query over a particular scope.  This demo also shows how to use the IRowsetPrioritization interface to set the indexing speed and priority of items also belonging to that scope.


Sample Language Implementations
====================================================
C++


Files:
====================================================
Eventing.sln
Eventing.vcproj
evtdemo.cpp


To build the sample using Visual Studio:
====================================================
     1. Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the ShellStorage directory.
     2. Double-click the icon for the ShellStorage.sln file to open the file in Visual Studio.
     3. In the Build menu, select Build Solution. The application will be built in the default \Debug or \Release directory.

	Note that this sample requires ATL (installed with Visual Studio).


To run the sample:
====================================================
     1. Navigate to the directory that contains the new executable using the command prompt
     2. Type evtdemo.exe at the command line to see the usage:

	Allows monitoring and prioritization of indexer URLs.
	
	Eventing.exe [drive:][path] [/p[:]priority] [/t[:]duration]
	
	  [drive:][path]
	             Specifies drive and directory of location to watch
	  /p         Prioritizes indexing at the given speed
	  priority     F  Foreground      H High
	               L  Low             D Default
	  /t         Specifies how long in MS to monitor query
	  duration     0     Until all content is indexed
	               NNNN  Monitor for NNNN milliseconds

	Examples would be:

	Eventing.exe /p:f C:\users

	To monitor all events occurring under C:\users and to prioritize any items needed to be indexed under that location.

	Eventing.exe /p:l /t:0 C:\music

	To monitor all events occurring under C:\music and to wait until all items have been indexed before exiting.
