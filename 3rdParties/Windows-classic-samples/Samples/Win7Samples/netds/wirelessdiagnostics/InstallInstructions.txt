1.Copy WlExtHC.exe to system32
2.Run L2SecExt.reg (you may have to remove sfp protection from SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\NetDiagFx.  Alternately, you can run regedt32 and import the L2SecExt.reg file)
3.Run WlExtHC.exe /RegServer (from system32\)

NOTE: The .reg file has a binary LaunchPermission key. This should setup the permissions so that Local Service can activate the extension. If you run into any problems, here's how to check the security settings:

    Give Local Service access to run the extension
       3a.Run Aministrative Tools > Component Services (or run "dcomcnfg" from the command-line)
       3b.Expand Component Services > Computers > My Computers> DCOM config, right click WirelessHelperClassExtension, select Properties
       3c.Under Security, Under Launch and Activation select customize and edit. Local Service should be listed and should have permissions for local launch and activation

4. Stop and start the dps service (net stop dps & net start dps)

Notes:
------
When writing your own helper class, please do the following:
1)  Replace the CLSID {00102030-4050-6070-8090-A0B0C0D0E0F0} everywhere with the CLSID of your helper class
2)  Use the IHV-specific DiagnosticsID instead of {00102000-0003-0004-0005-000000000006}
