IUri API Sample "URI"

URI is a simple example of creating and combining IUri objects.

This example is a command line application.  The user may execute the 
application with zero to two URI arguments.  When zero arguments are
provided help will be displayed.  When one URI argument is provided the example
will create an IUri object from the argument and display the object's 
properties.  When two URI arguments are provided the example will create an
IUri object that is the two URI arguments combined according to URI combining
rules and display the properties of the resulting IUri.
