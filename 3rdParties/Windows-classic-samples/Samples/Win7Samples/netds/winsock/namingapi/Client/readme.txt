Description

The Naming Client is used to register an email address so that it can be resolved to the IP address and port number that it is registered on. For instance, once the name is registered, you can ping it!
You will first need to install and run the Naming Provider sample (...\PeerToPeer\Naming\Provider) before using the client.
The only domain name with the email address supported by this sample is @sampleprovider.net

Type SampleClient.exe <EmailName>@sampleprovider.net from ...\PeerToPeer\Naming\Client\LH_DEBUG\
