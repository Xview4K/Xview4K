connectbylist.cpp:
---------
This IPv6 sample demonstrates the use of WSAConnectByList and dual-mode IPv4/IPv6 
sockets.

WSAConnectByList is new to Windows Sockets in Windows Vista.  

 
This sample requires that TCP/IP version 6 be installed on the system (default
configuration for Windows Vista).

The client builds a socket address list and connects to the server. This is done
for IPv4 (IPv6 v4-mapped address) and IPv6. 

Usage:
ConnectByList.exe
