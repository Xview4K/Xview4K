This sample demonstrates how to use the the LSA interface to the 
Kerberos authentication package on Microsoft Windows 2000 for the
purpose of viewing and deleting the Kerberos tickets granted to the 
current logon session.

This sample will only work on Windows 2000. To actually see any tickets,
your Windows 2000 machine must be joined to a Windows 2000 domain.

WARNING: Deleting Kerberos tickets can disable the full functionality of 
Windows 2000 for the current logon session.

See the Platform SDK for more information on the Kerberos protocol and 
Kerberos tickets.
