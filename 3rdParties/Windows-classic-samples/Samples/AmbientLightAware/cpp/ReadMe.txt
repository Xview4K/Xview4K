Ambient Light Aware
Windows 7 Sensor Platform
=========================
This MFC sample shows how to use the Sensor Platform by reading data from Ambient Light Sensors on the computer and changing a label's font size to be optimized for the reported light conditions.  Such as smaller font while inside and larger font while outside in a sunny environment.  The sample is not meant to be perfect in optimizing for light conditions, but done to show the usage of the Sensor Platform.  This sample requires Visual Studio to be built.
