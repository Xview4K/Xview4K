Process touch input with Direct Manipulation sample
===================================================

This sample shows how to process touch input with the [Direct Manipulation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh446969) APIs and support user interactions with smooth animations and feedback behaviors.Use these APIs to optimize UI response and reduce latency through off-thread input processing and predictive output based on the rendering time of the compositor.

Using two viewports, one nested in the other, this sample demonstrates:

-   Creating and configuring a viewport
-   Associating viewports with primary content
-   Establishing correct chaining and parent promotion behaviors between nested viewports
-   Registering event handlers to listen to viewport updates
-   Using [Direct Manipulation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh446969) with [DirectComposition](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh437371)

**Note**  The Windows-classic-samples repo contains a variety of code samples that exercise the various programming models, platforms, features, and components available in Windows and/or Windows Server. This repo provides a Visual Studio solution (SLN) file for each sample, along with the source files, assets, resources, and metadata needed to compile and run the sample. For more info about the programming models, platforms, languages, and APIs demonstrated in these samples, check out the documentation on the [Windows Dev Center](https://dev.windows.com). This sample is provided as-is in order to indicate or demonstrate the functionality of the programming models and feature APIs for Windows and/or Windows Server. This sample was created for Windows 8.1 and/or Windows Server 2012 R2 using Visual Studio 2013, but in many cases it will run unaltered using later versions.
