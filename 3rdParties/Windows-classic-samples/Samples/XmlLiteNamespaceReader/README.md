XmlLite XML namespace and node writer sample
============================================

This sample shows how to parse and handle namespaces when reading an XML document. It reads an XML file, and then prints the XML nodes and their namespaces to the console. An XML file that contains a namespace definition is included.The XmlLite library allows developers to build high-performance XML-based applications that provide a high degree of interoperability with other applications that adhere to the XML 1.0 standard. The primary goals of XmlLite are ease of use, performance, and standards compliance. XmlLite works with any Windows language that can use dynamic link libraries (DLLs), but Microsoft recommends C++. XmlLite comes with all necessary support files for use with C++, but if you want to use it with other languages, some additional work may be required.

**Note**  The Windows-classic-samples repo contains a variety of code samples that exercise the various programming models, platforms, features, and components available in Windows and/or Windows Server. This repo provides a Visual Studio solution (SLN) file for each sample, along with the source files, assets, resources, and metadata needed to compile and run the sample. For more info about the programming models, platforms, languages, and APIs demonstrated in these samples, check out the documentation on the [Windows Dev Center](https://dev.windows.com). This sample is provided as-is in order to indicate or demonstrate the functionality of the programming models and feature APIs for Windows and/or Windows Server. This sample was created for Windows 8.1 and/or Windows Server 2012 R2 using Visual Studio 2013, but in many cases it will run unaltered using later versions.
