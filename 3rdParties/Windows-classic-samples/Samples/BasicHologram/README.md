Basic hologram sample
=====================

Demonstrates a simple hologram rendered by a Win32 process.

Specifically, this sample runs on Windows Mixed Reality desktop PCs and renders a spinning cube. You 
can interact with the cube by placing it in a new position, and a variety of input methods are allowed.
This sample works on PCs with headset devices attached, and it works on Microsoft HoloLens.

This sample supports one operational mode: upon app launch, a spinning cube will appear in front
of the user. To move the spinning cube, look somewhere else, and then use any of these input 
methods to place it in front of you:
  * Air tap gesture, or "Select" speech command, when running on a Microsoft HoloLens
  * Controller trigger button, or "Select" speech command, when running on a PC with headset
  * The "A" button on an attached XBox 360 or XBox One controller
  * Left mouse click

This sample also shows how to use the CommitDirect3D11DepthBuffer API. This API allows the app to 
submit a depth buffer for per-pixel image stabilization.
