raw samples for desktop toasts using com activation

This sample demonstrates how a desktop app can display a toast notification and respond to events generated by the user's interaction (or lack of interaction) with the toast. 

This sample is provided as-is in order to indicate or demonstrate the functionality of the programming models and feature APIs.

How to use the sample: In the sample window, click the View Text Toast button. A sample toast notification appears on the screen. As the user, there are three actions you can take: Touch or click the toast. In a real-world app, this would commonly launch the associated app. Horizontally swipe the toast to dismiss it. Do nothing. The toast will time out. The action you take will be displayed in the sample window to demonstrate the receipt of the event. In a real-world situation, your app would respond appropriately to each of these events. Be aware that for a desktop app to be able to display toast notifications, that app must have a shortcut on the start menu. That shortcut must have an AppUserModelID.
